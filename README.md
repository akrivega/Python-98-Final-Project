# Spectra-Analysis-Project
This was a final project for Astro 98 - Python for Astronomers Decal at UC Berkeley. 
Group Members: Angela Beatty, Xinze Guo, Alexey Krivega, David Pham

The goal was to utilize data from Berkeley SETI's Automated Planet Finder to plot a 2D spectrum of Tabby's Star.
Then we extracted a 1D spectrum and found their H-alpha line and radial velocity using a doppler shift.

Another goal of the project was using data from ESOâ€™s Library of Stellar Spectra to plot 1D spectrum from OBAFGKM stars and compare their results. 
Our results told us that hotter stars peaks showing larger amounts of smaller wavelengths.
